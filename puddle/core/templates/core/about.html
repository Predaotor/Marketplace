        Welcome to Puddle, a unique marketplace where you can buy and sell items directly with other users. Our platform is designed to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions, making it easy for you to find great deals and sell your items without the hassle of traditional e-commerce platforms.
        <br><br>
        <strong>How It Works</strong>
        <br><br>
        On Puddle, you cannot place orders directly through the website. Instead, you can browse items listed by other users and contact the seller directly to arrange the purchase. This direct communication ensures transparency and allows you to negotiate the best deal.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Selling Items</strong>
        <br><br>
        If you have items you want to sell, simply create a listing on Puddle. Provide detailed information about your item, set your price, and wait for interested buyers to contact you. It's that simple!
        <br><br>
